The raw data was collected from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

As per UCI page: Data Set Information:
The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. 
Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 
The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.

The run_analysis.R script was run to obtain the final tidy dataset. As per requirement, script does the following:
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

#For changing the column names to be more descriptive following rules were used:
1. while merging itself, since features has names only for 561 cols, naming 562 as Label and 563 as Subject
2. all the () were removed from the original column names
3. since the domains are time and frequency, changed the variables with tVariableName to TimeDomainVarialeName and fVariableName to FrequencyDomainVariableName
4. changed Gyro to be Gyroscope
5. changed Acc to be Acceleration
6. changed Mag to be Magnitude
7. changed std to StandardDeviation
8. changed meanFreq to MeanFrequency

Then independent tidy dataset was created that shows the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
